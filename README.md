This system will hold all developer documentation, FAQs, resources and information on community efforts.

This project is built with Gatsbyjs and TypeScript which helps us create high performance web applications using React.js. 

To run the project locally, you need to install gatsby.js globally using the CLI command:

```bash
npm install -g gatsby-cli
```

Once you clone the repository, install all required dependences in the project and start a new development server with

```bash
npm install && gatsby develop
```

You can create an optimized build locally with:

```bash
npm run build
```
