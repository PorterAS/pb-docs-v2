Porterbuddy is a last mile delivery service platform. Customers of Porterbuddy can place delivery orders using this api.

The following describes the necessary steps to do a delivery using Porterbuddy:

Your retailer solution: Fetch delivery availability
End user: Choose delivery time
Your retailer solution: Place delivery order
Porterbuddy: Deliver the parcels at the requested time

### Time
All timestamps requires timezone to avoid ambiguity.

### Availability
An availability object is an entity that combines pickup address, delivery address, and delivery time. To be able to guarantee our ability to fulfill an order, you first need to obtain an availability entity before submitting an order for the requested time.

```jsx
import * as React from "react"
import { Link } from "gatsby"
import {Text} from '@chakra-ui/react'

import Layout from "../components/layout"
import SEO from "../components/seo"

const IndexPage = () => (
  <Layout>
    <SEO title="Home" />
    <Text fontSize="2xl">PB Developer Portal</Text>
    <p>Developer resources will live here</p>
    <Link to="/get-delivery-window">
      <Text fontSize="lg" fontWeight="bold">Click here to see a sample document in MDX</Text>
      </Link>
  </Layout>
)

export default IndexPage
```

### Order
The order contains all information needed to deliver to the end user. This includes addresses and delivery time, but also the availability for the package for pick up and requirements for identification, etc.

### Testing the API
If you want to test the API, you can send a request to dev@porterbuddy.com to receive a test API key.

### Get an API key
To get an API key for use in production, you first have to register as a user and customer at Porterbuddy. Currently, we only support payment by invoice. As a result the process of getting access is as follows:

Go to porterbuddy.com and register a user (of type business)
Contact dev@porterbuddy.com to enable payment by invoice
Receive your API key
Implementation Hints
We try to keep this API as stable as possible. However, implementing new services or features sometimes make changes necessary, for example adding new properties to API objects. To lower the risk of such a change breaking your integration, we advise to only define the properties of API responses your integration needs and always ignore unknown properties in received json objects. This is the default behaviour in Javascript (due to Javascript not being typed anyway) and Typescript when representing received API responses via interfaces. When using Jackson to implement JSON APIs in Java, the easiest way to achieve this is to use the annotation @JsonIgnoreProperties(ignoreUnknown=true)on classes representing API response data.
