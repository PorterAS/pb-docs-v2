## Overview

Consolidated orders (the "Samlevert" product) are created via the same request as regular orders. This is done by using the token from the consolidated window returned in the availability call to fill the data for the "consolidatedWindow" property in the create order request.

This should be done if the customer has chosen the consolidated delivery option during checkout. The data model for request and response is explained in the section [Place Order](https://developer.porterbuddy.com/#place-an-order), so this section only contains the different example request, the response has the same structure as for the non-consolidated case.

Note: This example request will not work as is. To create an actual consolidated order, several conditions have to be met:

- The customer needs to have an undelivered and accepted order, placed at Porterbuddy
- The cutoff for the delivery window chosen in the existing order is still in the future
- The consolidated window token isn't expired.
- If the consolidated window token has expired or is invalid, the order is created using the "best-available" approach.
