---

In the simulated API mode, the availability response data is simulated with a consolidated delivery available for the the email address "consolidated@porterbuddy.com". All other email addresses will not show consolidated delivery as an option.

In the real API mode, consolidation is available if there is already an open order for the entered email address and postcode stored in the Porterbuddy test environment. The code for the real API mode demo uses ES2015 language features and thus will not work as expected if tested in IE11.

This page demonstrates a basic use case of the unified shipping module. Feel free to explore it's functions here.

## Integration

General integration of the USM to use consolidation is the same as described in the sections about integrating the USM widget of this documentation. However, some specific requirements must be fulfilled in order to offer consolidation in the checkout. The consolidation option becomes available when the integration fulfills these requirements, and the consolidation feature is enabled for the store in Porterbuddy's infrastructure.

## Requirements

The availability request to Porterbuddy must be made with email, post code and street address in recipient.email, destinationAddress.postalCode and destinationAddress.streetName respectively.

- Using the address form in the module: Either the function `getPbAvailability` or the function `getShippingOptions` must be implemented. These will be passed recipientInfo (as an object), and are expected to return just an AvailabilityResponse (getPbAvailability), or the full set of shipping options (getShippingOptions).
- Prepopulated data: If you already have email, post code and street address before loading the module, you can make the availability request ahead of time, and prepopulate `recipientInfo` and the data in the shipping options in the initial configuration.

## Code Examples

```html
<script>
  // this example uses dayjs to generate pickup windows

  function pickupWindows() {
    // generating pickup windows for the next week starting today, 8-22 each day
    const pickupWindows = []
    for (let i = 0; i < 7; i++) {
      const start = dayjs()
        .add(i, "day")
        .hour(8)
        .minute(0)
        .second(0)
        .millisecond(0)
      const end = start.hour(22).minute(0)
      pickupWindows.push({
        start: start.toISOString(),
        end: end.toISOString(),
      })

    return pickupWindows
