Logos can be specified by setting the logoUrl property of a shipping option or in case of a location selection, the property of a location. If no logoUrl is provided, the shipping option will be shown without any logo. The Porterbuddy shipping option is always displayed with the Porterbuddy logo, no logoUrl needs to be specified for that.

## Logo images
Logo images can have a maximum size of 80 by 25 pixels, larger logos will be scaled down to fit those dimensions. Scaling is performed maintaining the aspect ratio. Logos should have a transparent background. A logo will be aligned top-right within the surrounding container.

## Logos served by the widget host
Logos for common shipping providers in the required dimensions are provided on the path "widget.porterbuddy.com/logos/". Currently, the following logos are provided:

| Image                                                     | Logo URL                                              |
