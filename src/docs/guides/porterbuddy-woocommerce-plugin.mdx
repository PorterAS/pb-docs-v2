### Checkout Template

Choose between two checkout templates, Porterbuddy Unified Shipping Module (USM) and the Checkout Widget. Porterbuddy recommends the USM to offer the best possible user experience with Porterbuddy.

### Pickup Options

These are the store pickup time windows. Specifying this allows for fine-grained control of the number of delivery days. Ex: If the package is ready for pick up from 3pm on Monday and the store closes at 7pm, the first window will be 3pm-7pm the first day, and the following windows should probably be the opening hours for the store the next days.

### Product Dimensions

Porterbuddy requires information on the product’s dimension to be shipped. You can set a global default dimension value for products. This data will be used for any product whose size or weight is unknown.

### Discount Table

Use this table to setup price discounts on the display price returned from Porterbuddy. The discount table provides the ability to specify a minimum cart size and an amount to be applied to it.
