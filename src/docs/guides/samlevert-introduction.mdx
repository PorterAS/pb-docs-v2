Samlevert, also known as Consolidated Delivery, is a Porterbuddy service that enables customers to receive multiple orders placed on a web store in one delivery. Customers can also place these orders [across several other supported stores](https://porterbuddy.com/samlevert), and the customer gets them in one delivery.
Some key considerations to note are:

1. The first order placed on any store is the primary order, and all other orders consolidated with it are secondary orders (or attachments)
2. The customer only pays a delivery fee for the primary order. All the secondary orders are free for the customer.
3. The order must be an active, accepted, and undelivered Porterbuddy order to serve as a primary order.
4. The cutoff time to receive orders from the store where the primary order is placed must not have passed for secondary orders to be added.

## Implementation considerations

The following is a concise summary of what is required to activate Samlevert for a storefront:

1. Porterbuddy has to activate Samlevert webstore’s account.
2. The storefront must send the customer's email, complete address, and postcode to Porterbuddy to check if Samlevert is available for the order.
3. Porterbuddy will return a Samlevert delivery window if consolidation is possible with a primary order, with zero shipping cost.
4. Suppose the customer selects the Samlevert delivery window. In that case, the store places the order by sending Porterbuddy the consolidated window, including other options required to create an order.

## Implementation estimate

Depending on the system of the webstore, the technical implementation should take approximately one day to complete.
