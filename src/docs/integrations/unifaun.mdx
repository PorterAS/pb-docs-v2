In this post, we’ll go over steps to add Porterbuddy as a sender in Unifaun Online. With this, a user  can create Porterbuddy shipments manually in Unifaun and have Porterbuddy as a delivery option when using Klarna Checkout with Klarna Shipping Assistant and Unifaun.

## Requirements

The following are required to complete this integration.

1. A Unifaun account. This account could be online or on-prem, and you can obtain it from the Unifaun team.
2. Adding Porterbuddy as a Carrier in Unifaun. This addition is set up by the Unifaun team and adds Porterbuddy as a carrier option.
3. Porterbuddy API key. This is obtained from the Porterbuddy retailer dashboard. Contact your account manager if you need access to a retailer dashboard or API Keys.
## Adding Porterbuddy as a Sender

To create a shipment with Porterbuddy, you need to add Porterbuddy as a sender in Unifaun. Follow these steps to achieve that:


1. Login to your account using your Unifaun credentials on https://www.unifaunonline.se/jsapp/uo/start
2. Click on the menu options; Maintenance > Senders > New Sender button
3. Enter the required sender delivery info: Name, Address, Post Code, and City
4. Enter the contact information of the sender, particularly the phone number and email
5. Click on *Add Carrier*, select *Porterbuddy* and add your Porterbuddy API key, in the carrier section.
6. Click on the *Save* button at the bottom of the page.

After completing this setup, Unifaun creates a new Sender, and you can book shipments right in Unifaun.


## Testing the integration

To test the integration, we will create a new booking right in Unifaun with the following steps:

1. We go to the *Shipments* menu and select *Standard printing*. A *Porterbuddy* option is also available and can be used if configured by Unifaun.
2. On the displayed page, we select the preferred sender, in this case, the Porterbuddy sender created in the first part.
3. We proceed to select a receiver or create a new receiver with accurate information.
4. We select a service type as *Normal* and services as *Porterbuddy.*
5. Next, we enter a pickup date and time.
6. Additional service options specific to Porterbuddy are available. These include a signature requirement, contactless delivery, etc.
7. We enter parcel information for each parcel and click *Add* to save the parcel data added.
8. Lastly, we click *Print PDF,* which creates a Porterbuddy shipment/order and opens a new page containing the generated label of the shipment. Here’s an example-generated label below.

## Integrating Unifaun in Klarna Checkout using Klarna Shipping Assistant (KSA)

With Porterbuddy active as a carrier in Unifaun, you may want to display shipping options in Klarna checkout using the KSA. 

This integration is achievable by setting up Unifaun as a profile in Klarna. To do this, you require a key and identifier from Unifaun. The identifier and key are a mix of Unifaun’s API keys and a Unifaun delivery checkout ID. 

1. **Identifier**: API-Key - Unifaun delivery checkout ID ie ER5BEWG777MM2SXS-396fd46d-8461-4560-9dea-2cde18e40bfa
2. **Key**: Unifaun Secret ID


> To utilize this KSA integration, you must have specified Porterbuddy as a carrier and sender on Unifaun.

Here’s how to obtain each credential:

- **API-Key and Secret ID**: In Unifaun, login and navigate to *Maintenance > API keys,* then click the search button to return all configured API Keys. Click on the Edit icon for an API key entry to see the associated Secret ID. 
- **Delivery checkout ID**: In Unifaun, navigate to *Maintenance > Delivery Checkout,* then click the search button to return all checkout instances. Each listed item contains a delivery checkout ID.
