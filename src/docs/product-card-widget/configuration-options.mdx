The Product card widget's appearance and behaviour can be influenced by configuration options. All configuration options are used by setting the respective properties on the `window.porterbuddy` object.

The property `onSetCallbacks` has a special behavior. This is a callback function that gets passed function references to methods that interact with the widget during runtime. The usage of this function is explained [here](/product-card-widget/callback-functions/).
