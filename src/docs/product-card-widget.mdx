# Product Card Widget

The product card widget is used on product pages to inform if a delivery with porterbuddy is available to a customer's postcode.

### INSERT PORTERBUDDY WIDGET

## Usage

Add the configuration and script tag anywhere in `<head>` or `<body>`.

```html
<link
  href="https://widget.porterbuddy.com/porterbuddy-widget.css"
  rel="stylesheet"
  type="text/css"
/>
<script
  async
  src="https://widget.porterbuddy.com/porterbuddy-widget.js"
></script>
```

The async attribute is optional, but recommended for better performance.

Configure the widget to show the "availability" view by defining the global variable.
`window.porterbuddy` in a script tag. If `window.porterbuddy` is not defined when the script loads it will delay execution for up to 10 seconds until it finds the configuration.

```html
<script>
  window.porterbuddy = {
    token: "y3wt37LqBsiLo62Jkx284XEdi4LzdX6pihZFwqYX",
    view: "availability",
    language: "NO",
  }
</script>
```

Add a `div` in `body` with the id `**porterbuddy-widget**` where you want the widget to appear on the page

```html
<div id="porterbuddy-widget"></div>
```

By default the widget is displayed without border or padding, but this can be added by setting **data-border**:

```html
<div id="porterbuddy-widget" data-border></div>
```
