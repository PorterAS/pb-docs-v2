The checkout widget supports periodic refreshes for the displayed delivery windows. Update intervals can be configured via the configuration options and are performed by the widget executing a callback function. This callback functions is called with 2 parameters, the first one is a function that needs to be called to pass in the new availability response, and the second one being additional delivery infos which should be passed into the availability API call.

The function set for the `onUpdateDeliveryWindows` will be called with the configured interval. Additional calls will be performed when a delivery window expires, or after user interaction for checking possible consolidation of deliveries.

Periodic updates should be implemented to ensure delivery windows are up to date during checkout, as each delivery window has an expiration time associated with it, after this a delivery window cannot be booked anymore, as Porterbuddy cannot guarantee delivery in that window anymore. Furthermore, delivery window availability can change due to capacity limits or other logistic reasons.

**Note**: Implementing the update callback function is mandatory to offer consolidation functionality!

## Sample code

```js
function updateDeliveryWindows(callback, additionalInfo) {
  var updatedAvailabilityResponse = // fetch from availability api with additionalInfo added to the request
  callback(updatedAvailabilityResponse);
}

var availabilityResponse = // fetch from availability API
window.porterbuddy = {
  token: 'y3wt37LqBsiLo62Jkx284XEdi4LzdX6pihZFwqYX',
  view: 'checkout',
  availabilityResponse: availabilityResponse,
  updateDeliveryWindowsInterval: 30, // update every 30 secons
  onUpdateDeliveryWindows: updateDeliveryWindows
};
```
